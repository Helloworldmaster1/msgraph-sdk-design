# BatchRequestContent

## Objectives

Provide a class that makes it simple to create the payload for a Graph Batch request.

## Requirements

See [constraints](ContentArchitecturalConstraints.md) related to all content objects.

- It MUST be possible to add native platform HTTP request objects to a BatchRequestContent object. The request URL MUST be a relative URL. Adding Graph specific Request objects MAY be supported.
- Added requests MUST be assigned unique identifiers. Those identifiers MAY be user provided or autogenerated.
- It MUST be possible to create dependencies between request objects.
- The serialized representation, written to a stream, or returned as a byte array MUST be a JSON object that conforms to the format described in the [Graph Documentation](1) and [OData specification](2). Request bodies must be base64 encoded.
- It MUST be possible to use a dictionary of existing unique identifiers and their corresponding to response status code to create a new/fresh `BatchRequestContent` instance to unlock re-emitting/retrying failed requests from an existing `BatchRequestContent` instance.

## Performance Considerations

A batch cannot hold more that 20 requests and requests cannot contain a batch request payload.

## Security Considerations

Requests that require additional consent, not already obtained, should not be included in a batch.

## Usage Examples

```cs
// create the batch request
var batchRequestContent = new BatchRequestContent(graphServiceClient);
var requestInformation = graphServiceClient.Users.ToGetRequestInformation();

// add step using requestInformation
var requestStepId = await batchRequestContent.AddBatchRequestStepAsync(requestInformation);

// add step using native platform HTTP request
var httpRequestMessage = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, "http://example.com");
var secondRequestStepId = batchRequestContent.AddBatchRequestStep(httpRequestMessage);

// send and get back response
var batchResponseContent = await graphServiceClient.Batch.PostAsync(batchRequestContent);

// enumerate list of failed requests and create a new batch request
var statusCodes = await batchResponseContent.GetResponsesStatusCodesAsync();
if(statusCodes.Any())
{
    var retryBatch = batchRequestContent.NewBatchWithFailedRequests(rateLimitedResponses);
    // send and get back response
    var retryBatchResponseContent = await graphServiceClient.Batch.PostAsync(retryBatch);
}
```
