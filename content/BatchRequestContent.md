# BatchRequestContent

## Objectives

Provide a class that makes it simple to create the payload for a Graph Batch request.

## Requirements

See [constraints](ContentArchitecturalConstraints.md) related to all content objects.

- It MUST be possible to add native platform HTTP request objects to a BatchRequestContent object. The request URL MUST be a relative URL. Adding Graph specific Request objects MAY be supported.
- Added requests MUST be assigned unique identifiers. Those identifiers MAY be user provided or autogenerated.
- It MUST be possible to create dependencies between request objects.
- The serialized representation, written to a stream, or returned as a byte array MUST be a JSON object that conforms to the format described in the [Graph Documentation](1) and [OData specification](2). Request bodies must be base64 encoded.

## Performance Considerations

A batch cannot hold more that 20 requests and requests cannot contain a batch request payload.

## Security Considerations

Requests that require additional consent, not already obtained, should not be included in a batch.
