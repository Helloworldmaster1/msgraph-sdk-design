# BatchRequestContentCollection

## Objectives

Provide a class that does not have limitation of that 20 requests by creating new `BatchRequestContent` objects to hold new requests to simplify the batching for advanced scenarios. 
The `BatchRequestContentCollection` is essentially a collection wrapper for `BatchRequestContent` and is not expected to be serializable as the individual `BatchRequestContent` instance are sent out independently and will receive independent responses.

## Requirements

Similar to [BatchRequestContent](BatchRequestContent.md), it must support the below functionality while holding a collection of BatchRequestContent instances.

- It MUST be possible to add native platform HTTP request objects to a BatchRequestContent object. The request URL MUST be a relative URL. Adding Graph specific Request objects MAY be supported.
- Added requests MUST be assigned unique identifiers. Those identifiers MAY be user provided or autogenerated. The uniqueness SHOULD be enforced/validated across the same `BatchRequestContent` instance the request objects are held in AND across the `BatchRequestContentCollection` instance.
- It MUST be possible to create dependencies between request objects. However, these dependencies SHOULD be enforced/validated across the same `BatchRequestContent` instance the request objects are held in and NOT across `BatchRequestContent` instances in the `BatchRequestContentCollection`.
- The addition of a new request object with a dependency, SHOULD make the best effort at placing the object in the same `BatchRequestContent` instance as its dependency and throw an error in the event this is not possible.
- It MUST be possible to configure the maximum number of request objects per `BatchRequestContent` in the `BatchRequestContentCollection` to a value lower than the default value of 20 request objects. This is to enable customized scenarios for developers and provide a means of client side optimization/throttling for workloads that may have lower maximums in batched requests.
- It MUST possible to use a dictionary of existing unique identifiers and their corresponding to response status code to create a new/fresh `BatchRequestContentCollection` instance to unlock re-emitting/retrying failed requests from an existing `BatchRequestContentCollection` instance.

> Given the similar API experience between `BatchRequestContentCollection` and `BatchRequestContent`, public documentation(code comments and examples) SHOULD encourage the use and point to `BatchRequestContentCollection` to avoid confusion for the end user. Adding new requests should automatically generate new `BatchRequestContent` instances to the `BatchRequestContentCollection`. `BatchRequestContent` should be a public facing type to enable users with customized batching scenarios.

## Performance Considerations

To minimize the risk of clients getting throttled by the API, the request client SHOULD send `BatchRequestContent` instances in sequence if the `BatchRequestContentCollection` contains more than one `BatchRequestContent` instance by default. The request client MAY send `BatchRequestContent` instances in parallel by use of a configuration parameter to allow the user to opt-in to this behavior in the event that the user is aware of the potential throttling limits.

## Usage Examples

```cs
// create the batch request content collection
var batchRequestContentCollection = new BatchRequestContentCollection(graphServiceClient);
var requestInformation = graphServiceClient.Users.ToGetRequestInformation();

// add step using requestInformation
var requestStepId = await batchRequestContentCollection.AddBatchRequestStepAsync(requestInformation);

// add step using native platform HTTP request
var httpRequestMessage = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, "http://example.com");
var secondRequestStepId = batchRequestContentCollection.AddBatchRequestStep(httpRequestMessage);

for (var i = 0; i < 25; i++) // its possible to add more than 20 requests
{
    BatchRequestStep batchRequestStep = new BatchRequestStep(i.ToString(), new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, REQUEST_URL));
    batchRequestContentCollection.AddBatchRequestStep(batchRequestStep);
}

// send and get back response
var batchResponseContentCollection = await graphServiceClient.Batch.PostAsync(batchRequestContentCollection);

// enumerate list of failed requests and create a new batch request
var statusCodes = await batchResponseContentCollection.GetResponsesStatusCodesAsync();
if(statusCodes.Any())
{
    var retryBatch = batchRequestContentCollection.NewBatchWithFailedRequests(rateLimitedResponses);
    // send and get back response
    var retryBatchResponseContentCollection = await graphServiceClient.Batch.PostAsync(retryBatch);
}
```
