# BatchRequestContentCollection

## Objectives

Provide a class that does not have limitation of that 20 requests by creating new `BatchRequestContent` objects to hold new requests to simplify the batching for advanced scenarios. 
The `BatchRequestContentCollection` is essentially a collection wrapper for `BatchRequestContent` and is not expected to be serializable as the individual `BatchRequestContent` instance are sent out independently and will receive independent responses.

### Requirements

Similar to [BatchRequestContent](BatchRequestContent.md), it must support the below functionality while holding a collection of BatchRequestContent instances.

- It MUST be possible to add native platform HTTP request objects to a BatchRequestContent object. The request URL MUST be a relative URL. Adding Graph specific Request objects MAY be supported.
- Added requests MUST be assigned unique identifiers. Those identifiers MAY be user provided or autogenerated. The uniqueness SHOULD be enforced/validated across the same `BatchRequestContent` instance the request objects are held in AND across the `BatchRequestContent` instances.
- It MUST be possible to create dependencies between request objects. However, these dependencies SHOULD be enforced/validated across the same `BatchRequestContent` instance the request objects are held in and not across `BatchRequestContent` instances.

> Given the similar API experience between `BatchRequestContentCollection` and `BatchRequestContent`, `BatchRequestContent` SHOULD be used internally and not exposed publicly to avoid confusion for the end user. Adding new requests should automatically generate new `BatchRequestContent` instances to the `BatchRequestContentCollection`.

### Performance Considerations

The request client MAY send `BatchRequestContent` instances in parallel if the `BatchRequestContentCollection` contains more than one `BatchRequestContent` instance
